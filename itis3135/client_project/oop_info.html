       <h1>Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
       <h2>Classes & Objects</h2>
       <p>Within Java we use Objects, self-contained entities
        that let us store & manipulate data, and Classes which
        we use to define these objects.
        </p>
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>If you've seen the examples in "Getting Started" you've seen
            that we put our main method in "MyClass", but you can have
            many classes in different files in your program.
            Let's print "Hello World!" using a class we made.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/client_project/newclass.png" alt="creating new class">
        <p>There's a few things here you may be confused about, so
            let's go through it.
        </p>
        <h3>Instance Variables</h3>
        <p>This class ("Hello") has 1 variable associated with it: 
            <span class="code">helloMessage</span>. This is what we are going to print later.
            We'll have to assign this instance variable to a value in the constructor.
        </p>
        <h3>Constructors</h3>
        <p>Classes in java need a constructor, or a way to actually make objects of that class.
            The constructor must match the name of the class, thus them both being called "Hello".
            Within the constructor we've assigned our instance variable to the parameter in our
            Hello constructor. When we build a Hello object later we're going to specify what the message will be.
        </p>
        <h3>Getters & Setters</h3>
        <p>Notice that "private" word next o helloMessage? This means 
            that variable is only accessible within this current class. What if we want to retrieve
            the message belonging to this Hello object, but can't access that variable? We make a Getter.
            The <span class="code">public String getMessage()</span> method will return the value of that variable.
        </p>
        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>Let's actually make that Hello object now.</p>
        <img src="../images/client_project/createobject.png" alt="creating hello object">
        <p>We've done it! Here's our new object, contained in the <span class="code">msg</span>
        variable. Notice we've placed the message we're going to print later inside the parenthesis.
        Let's retrieve that now.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/client_project/getter.png" alt="getter printing message">
        <p>All done! We've created a Hello object with our own message passed in, and used the getter method to retrieve the
            message within it. This should give you a basic understand of classes & objects in java.
