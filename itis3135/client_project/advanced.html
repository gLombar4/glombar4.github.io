       <h1>Advanced Concepts</h1>
       <h2>The Four Pillars</h2>
       <p>Within the concept of Object-Oriented Programming
        are the indivial concepts known as "The Four Pillars".</p>
        <p>
        These Pillars are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
       <!--TODO: Add hint images-->
       <h2>Abstraction</h2>
       <p>
        Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details
        & allowing a developer to work with only essential components.
        For example, using a function to handle specific operations that
        the developer shouldn't be concerned about.
       </p>
       <button type="button" onclick="showHint('abstract')">Show/Hide Example</button>
        <div class="hint" id="abstract" style="display: none;">
            <img src="../images/client_project/abstract.png" alt="abstraction">
            <p>In this example, we create a function to print a hello message,
                then we can just use that function later instead of having to perform
                whatever operation that function contains again.
            </p>
        </div>

       <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
       <p>If you've seen the "Getting Started" section you've already seen an example of this!
        Encapsulation essentially means containing things relating to a class inside of that class,
        instance variables, methods, etc.
       </p>

       <h2>Inheritance</h2>
       <p>Inheritance involves organizing classes into "super" and "sub" classes.
        For example, having an "Animal" superclass, of which "Dog" and "Cat" are subclasses.
       </p>
       <button type="button" onclick="showHint('inheritance')">Show/Hide Example</button>
        <div class="hint" id="inheritance" style="display: none;">
            <img src="../images/client_project/inheritance.png" alt="inheritance example">
            <p>
                Here we've defined an "Animal" class & have given all Animal objects
                a name attribute.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/client_project/inheritance2.png" alt="second inheritance example">
            <p>Now we'll make a Dog class and define it as a subclass of Animal. (Note the <span class="code">Extends</span> keyword.)
                <span class="code">super(name)</span> makes it so that all Dogs have names, but only Dog objects
                will have the "breed" attribute we've specified as part of this class. We've just made a superclass-subclass
                relationship.
            </p>
        </div>

       <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
       <p>Polymorphism means being able to use the same piece of code on multiple types of objects.
        From the above "Animal", "Cat" and "Dog" example, you should be able to use the same print method
        to print out information about cats and dogs. Despite being different objects & being made from different classes,
        they are both part of the Animal class, & thus can use polymorphism to their advantage.
       </p>
       <button type="button" onclick="showHint('polymorph')">Show/Hide Example</button>
       <div class="hint" id="polymorph" style="display: none;">
        <img src="../images/client_project/polymorph.png" alt="">
        <p>Building off the previous inhertiance example, notice how <span class="code">getName()</span>
        is from the Animal class. Despite this, since Dog and Cat objects are also Animals, they can use this method.
