       <h1>Advanced Concepts</h1>
       <h2>The Four Pillars</h2>
       <p>Within the concept of Object-Oriented Programming
        are the indivial concepts known as "The Four Pillars".</p>
        <br>
        These Pillars are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
       <!--TODO: Add hint images-->
       <p>We'll explore these concepts a little more in the
        "Advanced" section, so for now let's give a brief overview.
        Show the examples if you're confused!
       </p>
       <h2>Abstraction</h2>
       <p>
        Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details
        & allowing a developer to work with only essential components.
       </p>

       <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
       <p>If you've seen the "Getting Started" section you've already seen an example of this!
        Encapsulation essentially means containing things relating to a class inside of that class,
        instance variables, methods, etc.
       </p>

       <h2>Inheritance</h2>
       <p>Inheritance involves organizing classes into "super" and "sub" classes.
        For example, having an "Animal" superclass, of which "Dog" and "Cat" are subclasses.
       </p>

       <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
       <p>Polymorphism means being able to use the same piece of code on multiple types of objects.
        From the above "Animal", "Cat" and "Dog" example, you should be able to use the same print method
        to print out information about cats and dogs. Despite being different objects & being made from different classes,
        they are both part of the Animal class, & thus can use polymorphism to their advantage.
