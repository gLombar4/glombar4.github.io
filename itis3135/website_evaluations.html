        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.npr.org/">Site 1: NPR</a></h3>
            <p>The website for National Public Radio, with many many child stations.
                <p>C.R.A.P Principles:</p>
        <li>Contrast:</li>
        <p>This site keeps it basic with a white background and black text
            for the most part, but also has some blues and reds creating
            a pleasing contrast.
        </p>
        <li>Repetition:</li>
        <p>Each news story presented on the site is boxed & aligns with one another
            making the site feel consistent. It's broken up by larger
            sections with some standout stories.
        </p>
        <li>Alignment:</li>
        <p>As said before, each news section is aligned with one another across
            the entire page, and even the stories given a larger box align
            with the others horizontally.
        </p>
        <li>Proximity:</li>
        <p>The site contains quick links to headlines at the top
            for those who want to read straight away, and then other
            stories, which let you listen to the report, are below.
        </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Site 2: Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>The website for the Yale school of art, one of their graduate and professional schools.</p>
            <p>C.R.A.P Principles:</p>
        <li>Contrast</li>
        <p>The contrast here doesn't make the page completely unreadable,
            but it does make it difficult. The headers have background colors
            which don't match up & are way too close to the text.
        </p>
        <li>Repetition</li>
        <p>There's a lot of inconsistency on this page.
            Different background colors for different text segments being
            the main one I noticed.
        </p>
        <li>Alignment</li>
        <p>Almost no elements on this page are aligned with eachother,
            and there's no consistent center to the page. A few elements
            break out and go more toward the right.
        </p>
        <li>Proximity</li>
        <p>
            Best example I could find for this was the log-in button being below
            some of the other elements, making you scroll to find it.
            Typically I see this function at the very top of the page.
